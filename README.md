# Estate Manage Tenant Flutter App (Beta)

This is the frontend mobile app of the [EstateManage.Net platform](https://www.estatemanage.net). For detail documentation, please see the [backend repository](https://github.com/simonho288/estate-manage-backend).

## Installation

1. Login to your Firebase console to create a new project with Android and iOS Apps. Note that the `GoogleService-Info.plist` & `google-services.json` files you don't need to download & copy to your flutter project. It will be handled by FlutterFire as next instruction.

2. Follow the [FlutterFire](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/overview/) installation instructions to generate (auto generated by Firebase) `GoogleService-Info.plist`, `google-services.json`, and `firebase_options.dart`

3. Create new JSON file at `assets/cfg/dev.json`. Copy below contents to modify the values to your debug environment:

```json
{
  "hostApiUri": "<YOUR_BACKEND_URL>",
  "hostS3Base": "<YOUR_S3_ENDPOINT_URL>"
}
```

4. Modify the `assets/cfg/prod.json` & enter the values for your production environment.

5. Create a secret key file at `assets/cfg/secrets.json`. The contents are:

```json
{
  "enc_secret_key": "<you generate base 64 encryption key>",
  "enc_iv": "<you generate length 16 encryption key>"
}
```

Note: To generate above encryption keys, please follow the [Dart encrypt package](https://pub.dev/packages/encrypt). After the package installed, enter below commands:

```sh
$ secure-random -b 64 # copy&paste the value to above 'enc_secret_key'
$ secure-random -l 16 # copy&paste the value to above 'enc_iv'
```

## Debug The App

In Visual Studio Code, select the "Debug Mode" & press [F5] to start the debugger.

5. If your language is other than English, you can create a new language JSON file which copies from `assets/langs/en-US.json` to your language in same directory. For more information, please refer to the package [easy_locations](https://pub.dev/packages/easy_localization).

## Backend

This app cannot be executed alone. It requires connect to the [EstateManage backend](https://github.com/simonho288/EstateManage_backend). Please go to the backend repo for installation instructions.
